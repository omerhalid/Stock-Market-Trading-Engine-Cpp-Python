# Creating and Training the LSTM Model

## Model Purpose

The LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) used to predict future values in a time series. In this case, it's being used to predict stock prices.

## Data Collection

You've collected 20 years of daily stock data. This historical data is essential as LSTM models require a substantial amount of past data to learn patterns effectively.

## Data Preprocessing

- **Normalization**: The stock price data is normalized to scale the values within a specific range (usually between 0 and 1). This step is crucial because it helps the model learn more efficiently.

- **Time Series Formatting**: The data is then structured into sequences that the LSTM model can process. For instance, if you’re using 3 days of stock prices to predict the 4th day's price, each input sequence will contain data from 3 consecutive days.

## Training the LSTM Model

The model is trained on this preprocessed data. It learns to predict the stock price of the next day based on the input sequence of 3 days of prices.

## Making Predictions

- **Preparing Input for Prediction (X_test)**: To make a prediction, you prepare a new input sequence (X_test) that typically includes the most recent stock prices. For example, if your model was trained with sequences of 3 days to predict the 4th day, X_test should be the prices from the last 3 days.

- **Predicting Future Price**: The LSTM model uses X_test to predict the next day’s stock price. This prediction is based on the patterns it learned during training.

- **Inversion of Normalization**: The predicted price is initially in the normalized scale. You'll use the MinMaxScaler to convert it back to the original price scale.

## Function Call Timing

When you call the function to predict a stock price, it uses the data from the most recent 3 days available. If it's run on a trading day, it would use the 3 last available trading days' data (which could be the previous day or earlier if the stock market is closed).

## Additional Points

- **Accuracy and Reliability**: It's important to note that while LSTM can be effective in identifying patterns in time series data, stock price prediction is inherently complex and subject to many external factors. The model's predictions should be used with caution and in conjunction with other analysis.

- **Continual Learning**: In a real-world scenario, you'd periodically retrain the model with new data to keep it up-to-date with the latest market trends.

- **Backtesting**: Before relying on the model for actual trading decisions, it’s crucial to backtest its predictions against historical data to assess its performance.
