# Trading Strategies

## 1. Moving Average Crossover

A moving average (MA) smooths out price data to create a single flowing line, making it easier to identify the direction of the trend. The moving average crossover strategy involves using two MAs (one short and one long).

- **Buy Signal**: When the short-term MA crosses above the long-term MA.
- **Sell Signal**: When the short-term MA crosses below the long-term MA.

## 2. Mean Reversion

Mean reversion is based on the idea that prices and historical returns eventually return to the mean or average level of the entire dataset.

- **Buy Signal**: When the price of an asset deviates significantly below its historical average, suggesting it may be undervalued.
- **Sell Signal**: When the price significantly exceeds the historical average, indicating it may be overvalued.

## 3. Momentum Trading

Momentum trading involves buying and selling based on the strength of recent price trends.

- **Buy Signal**: When the asset's price has been rising, especially if accompanied by increased volume, indicating the trend might continue.
- **Sell Signal**: When the asset's price begins to lose momentum or shows signs of reversing.

## 4. Relative Strength Index (RSI)

RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. RSI oscillates between zero and 100.

- **Buy Signal**: An RSI value below 30 often indicates an oversold condition, suggesting a buying opportunity.
- **Sell Signal**: An RSI above 70 indicates an overbought condition, suggesting a selling opportunity.

## 5. Breakout Strategy

A breakout strategy involves entering a position as soon as the price makes a move above a defined resistance level or below a support level.

- **Buy Signal**: When the price breaks above a resistance level, indicating a potential upward trend.
- **Sell Signal**: When the price falls below a support level, indicating a potential downward trend.

# Implementing These Strategies in Your Project

## Data Analysis:

- Use your data source (like Alpha Vantage) to obtain historical price data.
- Calculate the necessary indicators (MAs, RSI, etc.) using this data.

## Signal Generation:

- Implement the logic for each strategy to generate buy or sell signals based on the calculated indicators.

## Execution Logic:

- Once a signal is generated, implement the logic in your C++ application to execute buy or sell orders.

## Risk Management:

- Always incorporate risk management rules, such as setting stop-loss orders and defining the size of the position.

## Backtesting:

- Before going live, backtest your strategies against historical data to evaluate their effectiveness.
